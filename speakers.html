														<br/>-Quantum computing<br/><br/>
														John Martinis attended U.C. Berkeley from 1976 to 1987.  His PhD thesis was a pioneering demonstration of quantum-bit states in superconductors. After postdoctoral research at CEA in France, he joined NIST Boulder where he developed electron counting devices and invented x-ray microcalorimeters.  In 2004 he moved to U.C. Santa Barbara where he continued work on quantum computation.  In 2014 he was awarded the London Prize for low-temperature physics research.  Last year he joined the Google quantum-AI team, and now heads an effort to build a useful quantum computer.
